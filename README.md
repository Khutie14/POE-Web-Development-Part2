🌐 POE Web Development Project
📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a responsive website as part of my Portfolio of Evidence (POE).
It includes semantic HTML, CSS styling, responsive images, and GitHub version control.

🔍 Reflection Notes (Testing & Iteration)
During testing, I used browser developer tools to preview the website on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
The desktop view displayed the layout correctly with full-width elements.
The tablet view required CSS adjustments for spacing and scaling.
The mobile view needed simplified layouts and smaller font sizes for readability.
Through iteration, I refined the design to ensure it was clean, accessible, and responsive across all devices.

📝 GitHub Workflow Notes (Part 2)
For Part 2 of the POE, I used GitHub to manage my project files and demonstrate version control.
I initialized my project with git init and connected it to a new GitHub repository.
I committed changes regularly with clear commit messages such as:
“Added responsive images with <picture> and srcset”
“Updated style.css for mobile and tablet layouts”
“Added screenshot placeholders in README.md”
“Wrote reflection notes for Part 2 testing”
I tested my website on desktop, tablet, and mobile views, and included screenshot placeholders in this README for evidence.
After each update, I used git push to sync my local changes with the remote GitHub repository.
This workflow ensured that my project is properly version-controlled, transparent, and accessible for review.
